# Image Enhancement Software

This Image Enhancement Software is a versatile tool developed using Flask and DALL-E, providing advanced algorithms for enhancing images with superior quality. The software supports two enhancement types: Low Light and Grayscale.

## Features

- **Low Light Enhancement:** Improves under-exposed low light images using the PSO Algorithm.
- **Grayscale Enhancement:** Converts images to grayscale and enhances them using the Genetic Algorithm.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Allows image upload through drag-and-drop or file selection.
- **Toggle Switch:** Enables users to easily switch between enhancement types.
- **Percentage Enhancement Display:** Shows the percentage of enhancement achieved based on the selected algorithm.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the application locally with `python main.py`.

## Deployment

The software can be deployed on various hosting platforms for easy accessibility.
